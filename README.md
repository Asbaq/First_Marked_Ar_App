## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### 🖼️ AR Interaction
- Users can interact with **virtual objects** using touch or gestures.
- The app uses **Vuforia** for **marker-based AR** to position virtual objects in real-world locations.
- Interactions include **scaling**, **rotation**, and **movement** of AR objects based on user input.

### 🎮 User Interface
- Simple, intuitive UI elements are used for **starting** and **interacting** with the AR experience.
- **AR markers** trigger the placement of virtual objects in the physical environment.
- **On-screen buttons** allow users to switch between different AR objects or scenes.

## 🛠️ Script Documentation

### 🎮 **ARManager.cs**
Manages **AR initialization**, object placement, and user interactions using Vuforia.

```csharp
using Vuforia;
using UnityEngine;

public class ARManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject virtualObject;

    void Start()
    {
        VuforiaBehaviour.Instance.RegisterVuforiaInitializedCallback(OnVuforiaInitialized);
    }

    private void OnVuforiaInitialized()
    {
        // Logic for handling the initialization of AR features
        virtualObject.SetActive(true);
    }

    public void PlaceObjectOnMarker()
    {
        virtualObject.transform.position = Camera.main.transform.position + Camera.main.transform.forward * 2f;
    }
}
```

### 🎮 **UIController.cs**
Handles **UI interactions** such as switching between AR scenes and displaying information.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class UIController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject infoPanel;

    public void ShowInfo()
    {
        infoPanel.SetActive(true);
    }

    public void HideInfo()
    {
        infoPanel.SetActive(false);
    }
}
```
